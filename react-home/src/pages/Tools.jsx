        <h3>Desktop</h3>
        <li>
          Mac Mini Core i7 2018, 32GB RAM, 128GB SSD - this was a bargain,
          bought refurbished in late 2021 for only Â£650. A great wee computer
          and{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          HP 23.8" Quad-HD Monitor - the perfect screen size for me and has a
          handy swivel stand so I can swing it around to portrait orientation
        </li>
        <li>
          MSI Optix 15.6" Ultra Slim Portable Monitor - a lightweight second
          screen which folds down smaller than most books
        </li>
        <li>
          Keychron K8 Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard with RBG backlight - who
          doesn't love a clacky mechanical keyboard with multiple rainbow light
          patterns?
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple Magic Mouse (white) - I was skeptical about a flat mouse but now
          I'll never go back. So much less strain on my wrist!
        </li>
      </List>
      <List>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <li>
          RocketBook - a wipe clean notebook with an accompanying app to scan
          and send notes straight to my Google Drive. Perfect for diagrams and
          planning.
